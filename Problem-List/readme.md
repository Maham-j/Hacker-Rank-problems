## Introduction 📝

This Python script defines a `Solution` class with a `twoSum` method. The `twoSum` method takes a list of integers (`nums`) and an integer target (`target`) as input and returns a list of indices representing the two numbers in the list that add up to the target. The solution uses a brute-force approach to find the indices.

## Usage 🚀

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/two-sum-solver.git
   ```

2. Run the script:

   ```bash
   python two_sum_solver.py
   ```

3. Modify the `nums` and `target` variables in the script with your desired input.

4. Call the `twoSum` method with the updated parameters.

5. The script will print the list of indices representing the two numbers that add up to the target.

## Installation 🛠️

There's no specific installation required. Just clone the repository and run the script as mentioned in the [Usage](#usage) section.
